2. How many files and folders are in this repository. ***(1 mark)*** __Fill answer here__..

   There is 1 file named README.md and 1 folder named images


## Exploring github codespaces

1. The next thing that we will be doing is exploring codespaces. First of all, read about codespaces https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview#what-is-a-codespace
2. Then go to the link https://github.com/codespaces and we shall start a new codespace.  
3. Click on ***New codespace***.
4. Choose your own Net&Sys Assignment repository to start your codespace.

5. Once you have created you codespace, you will see the following. You might already be familiar with this, since it will look similar to VSCode. 

 <img src="./images/UIwebvscode.png" width="70%">

6. You will see the [README file](./README.md) file. One is a preview of how it looks like on the web, and the other is the editing view in markdown language. 
7. Edit the [README file](./README.md). Make sure you have your group details correct, ie, group name and team members along with their matric Numbers. 
8. Once you have finish editing, click File->Save or ***ctrl-s*** to save it. 
9. After saving, you will notice an M or U next to your file. You will need to commit any changes, whenever you make changes so that it is uploaded to the github repository.

10. Click on the source control, hint: its on the left side panel, and it will list down the files that have been modified or updated. Click on commit. It will then ask you "Would you like to stage all your changes and commit them directly?" Just say yes, and a new tab will appear. Type a message to log what you have done, and click on the check mark.

## Running your own container instance.

1. At the terminal, run a linux instance. By typing the following command. 

docker pull debian
docker run --detach -it debian

bash
@farisrosly âžœ /workspaces/NatSysProject (main) $ docker pull debian
Using default tag: latest

latest: Pulling from library/debian
Digest: sha256:a92ed51e0996d8e9de041ca05ce623d2c491444df6a535a566dabd5cb8336946
Status: Image is up to date for debian:latest
docker.io/library/debian:latest

@farisrosly âžœ /workspaces/NatSysProject (main) $ docker run --detach -it debian
21bc997724f53455054a6a8e2f4fa09732843d4af0c2ea54af79df7777b8844e

2. This will run the debian container. To check if the debian container is running, type
bash
@joeynor âžœ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
f65be1987f84   debian    "bash"    4 minutes ago   Up 4 minutes             romantic_jackson

bash
@farisrosly âžœ /workspaces/NatSysProject (main) $ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
e53e712fdcc0   debian    "bash"    30 seconds ago   Up 27 seconds             stupefied_keller


3. Keep note of the name used by your container, this is usually given random names unless you specify your own name. Now run a bash command on the container. Make sure you use the name of your container instead of the one shown here. 
bash
docker exec -i -t romantic_jackson /bin/bash

bash
@farisrosly âžœ /workspaces/NatSysProject (main) $ docker exec -i -t e53e712fdcc0 /
bin/bash



4. Create a file on the container. First you must make sure you are in the bash command prompt of the container. The container is new, and does not have any software other than the debian OS. To create a new file, you will need an editor installed. In the bash shell of the container, run the package manager apt-get to install nano text editor. 

bash
root@f65be1987f84:~# apt-get update      

root@f65be1987f84:~# apt-get install nano

**Questions:**

1. Are files in the container persistent. Why not?. *(1 mark)* _Fill answer here_.

No, files in a Docker container are not persistent by default. This is because containers are designed to be ephemeral and stateless. When a container is deleted, its filesystem and any changes made within the container are also removed. To persist data beyond the life of a container, you need to use Docker volumes or bind mounts, which allow data to be stored on the host system and survive container restarts and deletions.

2. Can we run two, or three instances of debian linux? . *(1 mark)* _Fill answer here_.

 Yes, you can run multiple instances of Debian Linux containers. Docker allows you to create and run multiple containers from the same image simultaneously. Each container runs in its own isolated environment with its own filesystem, processes, and network interfaces. To run multiple instances, you can simply execute the docker run command multiple times, and Docker will create and manage these instances independently.

## Running your own container with persistent storage

1. In the previous experiment, you might have notice that containers are not persistent. To make storage persistent, you will need to mount them. 
At the terminal, create a new directory called **myroot**, and run a instance of debian linux and mount myroot to the container. Find out the exact path of my root, and mount it as the root folder in the debian container. 
2. Create a file in /root on the container, the files should also appear in myroot of your host VM.

```bash 
@joeynor âžœ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ mkdir myroot
@joeynor âžœ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ cd myroot/
@joeynor âžœ /workspaces/OSProject/myroot (main) $ pwd
/workspaces/OSProject/myroot

@joeynor âžœ /workspaces/OSProject/myroot (main) $ docker run --detach -it -v /workspaces/OSProject/myroot:/root debian
```

***Questions:***

1. Check the permission of the files created in myroot, what user and group is the files created in docker container on the host virtual machine? . ***(2 mark)*** __Fill answer here__.
2. Can you change the permission of the files to user codespace.  You will need this to be able to commit and get points for this question. ***(2 mark)***
```bash
//use sudo and chown
sudo chown -R codespace:codespace myroot

```

## You are on your own, create your own static webpage

1. Create a directory called webpage in your host machine
2. Inside the directory, create a page index.html, with any content you would like
3. Then, run the apache webserver and mount the webpage directory to it. Hint:
```bash
## the -p 8080:80 flag points the host port 8080 to the container port 80

docker run --detach -v /workspaces/OSProject/webpage:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ -p 8080:80 httpd
```

4. If it works, codespace will trigger a port assignment and provide a URL for you to access your webpage like the one below.

5. You can also see the Port in the **PORTS** tab, next to the terminal tab.

6. You can then access your website by adding an index.html towards the end of your url link, like the one below. 

 <img src="./images/helloworldweb.png" width="70%">

***Questions:***

1. What is the permission of folder /usr/local/apache/htdocs and what user and group owns the folder? . ***(2 mark)*** __Fill answer here__.
2. What port is the apache web server running. ***(1 mark)***
3. What port is open for http protocol on the host machine? ***(1 mark)***

## Create SUB Networks

1. In docker, you can create your own private networks where you can run multiple services, in this part, we will create two networks, one called bluenet and the other is rednet
2. Run the docker create network to create you networks like the ones below
```bash
## STEP 1:
## Create Networks ##
docker network create bluenet
docker network create rednet`

## STEP 2: (automatically running)
## Create (1) Container in background called "c1" running busybox image ##
docker run -itd --net bluenet --name c1 busybox sh
docker run -itd --net rednet --name c2 busybox sh
```
***Questions:***

1. Describe what is busybox and what is command switch **--name** is for? . ***(2 mark)*** __Fill answer here__.
2. Explore the network using the command ```docker network ls```, show the output of your terminal. ***(1 mark)***
3. Using ```docker inspect c1``` and ```docker inspect c2``` inscpect the two network. What is the gateway of bluenet and rednet.? ***(1 mark)***
4. What is the network address for the running container c1 and c2.
5. Using the command ```docker exec c1 ping c2```, which basically issue a ping from container c1 to c2. Are you able to ping? Show your output . ***(1 mark)***

## Bridging two SUB Networks
1. Let's try this again by creating a network to bridge the two containers in the two subnetworks
```
docker network create bridgenet
docker network connect bridgenet c1
docker network connect bridgenet c2
docker exec c1 ping c2
```

## What to submit

1. Make sure to commit all changes on your source control, and make sure your source control is sync to the repository. 
2. Check your repository link, to see if all the files and answers are included in the repository. 
3. Submit through italeem, by providing the link to your repository.
4. Due by ***30 May, 2024***
